# Audio Streaming Implementation

## Overview

This document explains the implementation of a WebSocket-based audio streaming system that converts WAV files to MP3, chunks them into frames, and streams them to clients in real-time. The system ensures smooth playback by sending frames at appropriate intervals.

## Audio Configuration

```python
# Audio configuration
SAMPLE_RATE = 8000
BYTE_PER_SAMPLE = 2
CHANNELS = 1
FRAME_SAMPLES = 1152  # One MP3 frame contains 1152 samples
FRAME_MS = int((FRAME_SAMPLES / SAMPLE_RATE) * 1000)  # ~144ms per frame
```

### Design Decisions

1. **Sample Rate (8kHz)**: 
   - Lower than CD quality (44.1kHz) to reduce bandwidth requirements
   - Sufficient for voice audio which is our primary use case
   - Compatible with most audio processing systems

2. **Bit Depth (16-bit)**:
   - Standard for most audio applications
   - Provides good dynamic range for voice audio
   - Compatible with most audio processing systems

3. **Channels (Mono)**:
   - Simplified processing compared to stereo
   - Reduced bandwidth requirements
   - Sufficient for voice audio

4. **Frame Samples (1152)**:
   - Standard for MP3 encoding
   - Each MP3 frame contains 1152 samples
   - Determines the frame duration: 1152/8000 = 0.144 seconds

## Processing Pipeline

### 1. File Loading

```python
# Read and convert the WAV file
audio_segment = AudioSegment.from_wav(WAV_MONO)
```

**Design Decision**: Use `pydub` library for audio processing because:
- Provides a simple API for audio manipulation
- Handles various audio formats
- Abstracts low-level audio processing details

### 2. MP3 Conversion

```python
# Convert entire file to MP3 once
buffer = io.BytesIO()
audio_segment.export(
    buffer,
    format='mp3',
    bitrate='8k',
    parameters=[
        "-ac", str(CHANNELS),
        "-ar", str(SAMPLE_RATE)
    ]
)
mp3_data = buffer.getvalue()
```

### 3. Frame Detection

```python
# Find the start of actual audio data (after metadata)
# MP3 sync word is 0xFF 0xFB
audio_start = 0
for i in range(len(mp3_data) - 1):
    if mp3_data[i] == 0xFF and mp3_data[i+1] == 0xFB:
        audio_start = i
        break
```

**Design Decision**: Detect the start of actual audio data by looking for the MP3 sync word (0xFF 0xFB) to:
- Skip any metadata at the beginning of the MP3 file
- Ensure we're only sending actual audio data
- Maintain proper MP3 frame alignment

### 4. Chunking Strategy

```python
# Calculate frame size based on average MP3 frame size
# For 8k bitrate, each frame is roughly 400-600 bytes
frame_size = 549  # Based on observed frame size from logs

# Calculate number of frames
total_frames = (len(mp3_data) - audio_start) // frame_size
```

**Design Decisions**:

1. **Fixed Frame Size (549 bytes)**:
   - Empirically determined by observing the natural MP3 frame boundaries
   - Aligns well with the actual MP3 frame structure
   - Ensures clean transitions between chunks

2. **Frame Size vs. Duration**:
   - Frame duration: 144ms (1152 samples at 8kHz)
   - Frame size: 549 bytes
   - The relationship is complex due to MP3 encoding and frame structure
   - Actual data rate: ~3.8 KB/s (higher than nominal bitrate due to frame overhead)

### 5. Frame Processing

```python
# Process one frame at a time
for i in range(audio_start, len(mp3_data), frame_size):
    # Extract one frame of MP3 data
    frame_data = mp3_data[i:i + frame_size]
    
    # Skip empty frames
    if len(frame_data) == 0:
        continue
        
    # Create message
    message = {
        "event": "chunk",
        "media": {
            "payload": base64.b64encode(frame_data).decode('utf-8'),
            "is_sync": True
        }
    }
```

**Design Decisions**:

1. **Base64 Encoding**:
   - Ensures binary data can be safely transmitted as text
   - Compatible with JSON serialization
   - Widely supported by WebSocket implementations

2. **Sync Flag**:
   - Indicates that this is a synchronization point
   - Helps clients maintain proper playback timing
   - Useful for handling network jitter

### 6. Timing Control

```python
# Sleep for half a frame duration
await asyncio.sleep(FRAME_MS / 2000.0)
```

**Design Decision**: Sleep for half a frame duration (72ms) between sending frames to:
- Ensure the next frame arrives before the current one finishes playing
- Provide a buffer for network jitter
- Maintain smooth playback

### 7. Final Frame Handling

```python
# Send any remaining data as the last frame
remaining_data = mp3_data[audio_start + (frame_count * frame_size):]
if len(remaining_data) > 0:
    message = {
        "event": "chunk",
        "media": {
            "payload": base64.b64encode(remaining_data).decode('utf-8'),
            "is_sync": True
        }
    }
```

**Design Decision**: Send any remaining data as a final frame to:
- Ensure no audio data is lost
- Handle partial frames at the end of the file
- Maintain complete audio playback

## WebSocket Communication

```python
async def send_payload_to_clients(payload: bytes | str | dict, data_type="text"):
    """Send payload to all connected clients."""
    for client in clients.copy():
        try:
            if data_type == "binary":
                await client.send_bytes(payload)
            if data_type == "json":
                await client.send_json(payload)
            if data_type == "text":
                await client.send_text(payload)
        except (WebSocketDisconnect, ConnectionClosed):
            clients.discard(client)
            logger.error("Client disconnected during send")
```

**Design Decisions**:

1. **WebSocket Protocol**:
   - Provides full-duplex communication
   - Lower overhead than HTTP for streaming
   - Widely supported by browsers and servers

2. **Client Management**:
   - Maintain a set of connected clients
   - Remove disconnected clients
   - Send to all connected clients

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Catch and handle WebSocket exceptions
   - Log errors for debugging
   - Continue sending to other clients if one disconnects

## Key Insights

1. **Frame Size Selection**:
   - The 549-byte frame size was determined empirically
   - It aligns with the natural MP3 frame boundaries
   - This ensures clean transitions between chunks

2. **Complete Data Transmission**:
   - We ensure all MP3 data is sent by handling the partial last frame
   - This guarantees complete audio playback

3. **Timing Control**:
   - Sleeping for half a frame duration ensures smooth playback
   - This provides a buffer for network jitter

4. **MP3 Frame Alignment**:
   - By using a frame size that aligns with the natural MP3 frame boundaries
   - We ensure clean transitions between chunks

## Results

- Successful streaming of the complete audio file
- Smooth playback with no gaps or interruptions
- Efficient use of bandwidth with appropriate chunk sizes
- Robust handling of the entire audio data

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a reliable and efficient way to stream audio data in real-time, ensuring smooth playback while maintaining data integrity. The design decisions are based on empirical observations and best practices for audio streaming.
